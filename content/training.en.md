I regularly host training sessions for professionals.

Those can be linked to the **continuing education** program at ENSC. For more details, you might check the school's offering regarding [university certicates](https://ensc.bordeaux-inp.fr/fr/autres-diplomes-ensc) and [short courses](https://ensc.bordeaux-inp.fr/fr/les-formations-courtes-lensc).

I have recently been in charge of the following content:

- _Machine Learning_, _Deep Learning_ and _MLOps_, as part of the [Artificial intelligence](https://ensc.bordeaux-inp.fr/fr/formation-courte-intelligence-artificielle) short course (sessions of June 2020, June 2021 and November 2021) ;
- _Introduction to Deep Learning_, as part of the [Big Data and Statistics for Engineers](https://ensc.bordeaux-inp.fr/fr/du-big-data-et-statistique-pour-lingenieur) university diploma (every year since 2019).

As an **independent instructor**, I can also craft custom training courses. Leveraging my professional skills and experience, they are tailored to one's specific business context and objectives.

Feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:bpesquet%20[at]%20gmail%20[dot]%20com?subject=Training%20course%20project) in order to design together the training course that would answer your needs.
