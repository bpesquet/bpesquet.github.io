👋 Hi there! I'm a software engineer, teacher and instructor currently living near Bordeaux, France.

🏫 I mainly work at the [Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Cognitique](https://ensc.bordeaux-inp.fr) where I teach computer science and artificial intelligence to graduate students and professionals.

🤝 I sometimes do freelancing in my areas of knowledge. Let's get in touch!
