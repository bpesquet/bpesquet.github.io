The following projects are being used in some of my courses.

- [pyfit](https://github.com/bpesquet/pyfit) is a minimalist neural networks library built on a tiny autodifferention engine.

- [WinForms architecture patterns](https://github.com/bpesquet/winforms-architecture-patterns) demonstrates several architectural patterns for building desktop applications.
