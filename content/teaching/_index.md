I strive to make my pedagogical resources available to everyone.

Unless otherwise stated, these resources are free to use for non-commercial purposes (Creative Commons [BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license). Most of them are open-sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/bpesquet?tab=repositories). The presentations are built with [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/).
