## Online resources

As a teacher, my core activity is authoring and presenting pedagogical content to students and professionals. Over the years, I have taught a pretty large variety of computer-related subjects, from programming basics to Deep Learning. For many years now, I have strived to make most of my teaching resources available online.

The following material spans a 20-ish years long teaching career. Some resources are maintained on a (somewhat) regular basis and should be reasonably up-to-date. Older stuff is most certainly outdated, but still might be relevant in some contexts.

## School-related work

Most of this work is currently taking place at the [Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Cognitique](https://ensc.bordeaux-inp.fr) (ENSC), a French graduate engineering school. Since 2018, I also teach a Machine Learning introductory course at the [Institut d'Optique Graduate School](https://www.institutoptique.fr).

From 2019 to 2021, I co-created and co-steered a joint specialization track devoted to artificial intelligence with [ENSEIRB-MATMECA](https://enseirb-matmeca.bordeaux-inp.fr), another engineering school of [Bordeaux INP](https://www.bordeaux-inp.fr). Since 2022, each school manages its own version of the track. I'm still in charge of the ENSC-specific one.

## Training programs

I host training sessions for professionals or external partners on a regular basis.

Some of these are linked to the continuing education program at ENSC. More precisely, I recently took part in the [Artificial Intelligence](https://ensc.bordeaux-inp.fr/fr/formation-courte-intelligence-artificielle) short course (in 2021 and 2022) and the [Big Data and Statistics for Engineers](https://ensc.bordeaux-inp.fr/fr/du-big-data-et-statistique-pour-lingenieur) university diploma (since 2019).

From 2021 to 2023, I have been involved in the [Machine Learning for Defence](https://assets-plus.eu/education-training/machine-learning-for-defence/) and [AI for Defence](https://year-of-skills.europa.eu/events-and-activities/assets-education-training-programme-ai-defence-2023-05-22_en) training programs for professionals, created as part of the [ASSETs+](https://assets-plus.eu/) european project.
