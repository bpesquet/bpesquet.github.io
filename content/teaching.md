## School-related work

As a teacher, my core activity is creating and presenting courses to students. Since the beginning of my career, I taught a pretty wide variety of computer-related subjects, from programming basics to Deep Learning (see [below](#online-resources) for a list of associated resources).

Most of this work is currently taking place at the [Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Cognitique](https://ensc.bordeaux-inp.fr). Since 2018, I also teach a Machine Learning introductory course at the [Institut d'Optique Graduate School](https://www.institutoptique.fr).

From 2019 to 2021, I co-created and co-steered a joint specialization track devoted to artificial intelligence with [ENSEIRB-MATMECA](https://enseirb-matmeca.bordeaux-inp.fr), another engineering school of [Bordeaux INP](https://www.bordeaux-inp.fr). Since 2022, each school manages its own version of the track. I'm still in charge of the ENSC-specific one.

## Training programs

I also regularly host training sessions for professionals or external partners.

Some of them are linked to the continuing education program at [ENSC](https://ensc.bordeaux-inp.fr). More precisely, I recently took part in the [Artificial Intelligence](https://ensc.bordeaux-inp.fr/fr/formation-courte-intelligence-artificielle) short course (in 2021 and 2022) and the [Big Data and Statistics for Engineers](https://ensc.bordeaux-inp.fr/fr/du-big-data-et-statistique-pour-lingenieur) university diploma (since 2019).

From 2021 to 2023, I have been involved in the [Machine Learning for Defence](https://assets-plus.eu/education-training/machine-learning-for-defence/) and [AI for Defence](https://year-of-skills.europa.eu/events-and-activities/assets-education-training-programme-ai-defence-2023-05-22_en) training programs, created as part of the [ASSETs+](https://assets-plus.eu/) european project.

## Online resources

I strive to make the pedagogical resources created through my teaching activity available to everyone. Unless otherwise stated, they are free to reuse under a [Creative Commons BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license for text and [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) for source code.
