After graduating as a software engineer in 1999, I worked for several years in the industry before moving on to a teaching career. In 2008, I passed the *agrégation* (highest competitive exam for teaching in France).

Since 2016, I work as full-time professor at the [Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Cognitique](https://ensc.bordeaux-inp.fr/), a graduate engineering school in which I teach various computer science and AI-related courses.

In 2023, I started a PhD in AI with [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr). My research focuses on artificial metacognition, i.e. how to create autonomous agents able to explicitly evaluate and adapt their behavior.
