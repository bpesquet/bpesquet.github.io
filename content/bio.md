After graduating as a software engineer in 1999, I worked for several years in the industry before moving on to a teaching career. In 2008, I passed the *agrégation* (highest competitive exam for teaching in France).

Since 2016, I work as full-time professor at the [Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Cognitique](https://ensc.bordeaux-inp.fr/), a graduate engineering school where I [teach](../teaching) various computer science and AI-related courses.

In 2023, I started a [PhD](../research) in AI with [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr), with the goal of augmenting artificial agents with metacognitive abilities.
