👋 Hi there! I'm a software engineer and teacher currently living near Bordeaux, France.

🏫 I [teach]({{< ref "teaching" >}}) computer science and artificial intelligence to graduate students of the [Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Cognitique](https://ensc.bordeaux-inp.fr/en).

🤝 I also do [training missions]({{< ref "training" >}}) for professionals or external partners.

📚 Some of my [pedagogical resources]({{< ref "resources" >}}) are available online.

✍️ I [blog]({{< relref path="/posts" lang="fr" >}}) infrequently about technical or pedagogical issues.
