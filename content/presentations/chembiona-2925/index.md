## A brief history of AI

### A recent discipline

Kickoff: [1956 Dartmouth workshop on Artificial Intelligence](http://jmc.stanford.edu/articles/dartmouth/dartmouth.pdf), with high ambitions:

> "AI is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines." ([John McCarthy](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)>))

> "Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it." ([Dartmouth workshop proposal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop))

> "AI is the science of making machines do things that would require intelligence if done by men." ([Marvin Minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky))

### What is intelligence, by the way?

Controversial definition, varying in what its abilities are and whether or not it is quantifiable.

> "Intelligence is the ability to perceive or infer information; and to retain it as knowledge to be applied to adaptive behaviors within an environment or context." ([Radha R. Sharma](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/097226290801200108))

> "Intelligence is what you use when you don't know what to do." ([Jean Piaget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Piaget))

### A few traits of AI

- Main fields of research:
  - **Problem solving** (e.g. search algorithms, constraint solving).
  - **Reasoning** and **decision making** (e.g. logic, knowledge representation).
  - **Machine Learning** (e.g. systems that improve with experience).
  - **Real-world interactions** (e.g. computer vision, natural language understanding).
- Either purely **software**-based, or embedded in **hardware** devices.
- Flavors:
  - **Substitutive**: replacement of men by machines on specific tasks.
  - **Augmented**: human-centered AI for performance augmentation or autonomy enhancement.
  - **Hybrid**: human-machine collaboration on complex tasks.

### So... What is AI, actually?

> "AI is an **interdisciplinary** field aiming at **understanding** and **imitating** the mechanisms of **cognition** and **reasoning**, in order to **assist** or **substitute** humans in their activities." ([Commission d'enrichissement de la langue franÃ§aise](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_d%27enrichissement_de_la_langue_fran%C3%A7aise), 2018)

> "[AI is whatever hasn't been done yet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_effect)." ([Larry Tesler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Tesler))
