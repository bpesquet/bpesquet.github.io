## A brief history of AI

### A recent discipline

<div class="columns">
<div>

Kickoff: [1956 Dartmouth workshop on Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop).

> "AI is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines." ([John McCarthy](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)>))

> "AI is the science of making machines do things that would require intelligence if done by men." ([Marvin Minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky))

</div>

</div>

### High ambitions

> "Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it." ([Dartmouth workshop proposal](http://jmc.stanford.edu/articles/dartmouth/dartmouth.pdf), 1956)

> "Machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do." ([Herbert Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon), 1965)

> "In for three to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being." ([Marvin Minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky), 1970)

### What is intelligence, by the way?

Controversial definition, varying in what its abilities are and whether or not it is quantifiable [[Legg and Hutter, 2007](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1565458)].

> "Intelligence is the ability to perceive or infer information; and to retain it as knowledge to be applied to adaptive behaviors within an environment or context [[Radha R. Sharma, 2008](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/097226290801200108)]."

> "Intelligence is what you use when you don't know what to do." ([Jean Piaget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Piaget))

### The AI landscape

- Main fields of research:
  - **Problem solving** (e.g. search algorithms, constraint solving).
  - **Reasoning** and **decision making** (e.g. logic, knowledge representation).
  - **Machine Learning** (e.g. systems that improve with experience).
  - **Real-world interactions** (e.g. computer vision, natural language understanding).
- Either purely **software**-based, or embedded in **hardware** devices.

### A highly interdisciplinary field

### A tumultuous history

### Two competing approaches

### How to define AI?

> "AI is an **interdisciplinary** field aiming at **understanding** and **imitating** the mechanisms of **cognition** and **reasoning**, in order to **assist** or **substitute** humans in their activities." ([Commission d'enrichissement de la langue franÃ§aise](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_d%27enrichissement_de_la_langue_fran%C3%A7aise), 2018)

> "[AI is whatever hasn't been done yet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_effect)." ([Larry Tesler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Tesler))

## AI's booming present

### Machine Learning: a new paradigm

> "The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." ([Arthur Samuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Samuel_(computer_scientist)), 1959).

![Programming paradigm](images/programming_paradigm.png)

![Training paradigm](images/training_paradigm.png)

#### Algorithm #1: K-Nearest Neighbors

Prediction is based on the $k$ nearest neighbors of a data sample.

[![K-NN](images/knn.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm)

#### Algorithm #2: Decision Trees

Build a **tree-like structure** based on a series of learned questions on the data.

![Decision Tree for Iris dataset](images/dt_iris.png)

#### Algorithm #3: Artificial Neural Networks

Layers of **loosely neuron-inpired computation units** that can approximate any continuous function.

### The Deep Learning tsunami

Subfield of Machine Learning consisting of **multilayered neural networks** trained on vast amounts of **data**.

In a decade,  outperformed previous SOTA approaches in many fields (computer vision, language, processing, and much more).

## The uncertain future(s) of AI

### AI's growing impact on individuals and society

AI has more and more social and societal implications:

- Job market transformation.
- Human/machine interactions.
- Trust and acceptability.
- Legal aspects and regulation ([AI hallucination cases](https://www.damiencharlotin.com/hallucinations/)).
- Fairness.
- Ethics.
- Privacy and usage of personal data.
- ...

### Which AI will prevail?

- **Substitutive intelligence**: replacement of men by machines.
- **Augmented intelligence**: human-centered AI for performance augmentation & autonomy enhancement.
- **Hybrid intelligence**: human-machine collaboration on complex tasks.

### The AGI debate

- AGI = **Artificial General Intelligence**
  - The ability to perform any task as well as a human.
- Related concept: **strong AI** (intentionality anc consciousness).
- Are recent models *sparks of AGI* [[Buceck et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712)] or merely *stochastic parrots* [[Bender et al. 2021](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922)]?

### The technological singularity
