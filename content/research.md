My research focuses on *artificial metacognition*, i.e. how to create autonomous agents able to explicitly evaluate and adapt their behavior.

## PhD

Since 2023, I am working on a PhD in artificial intelligence under the supervision of [FrÃ©dÃ©ric Alexandre](https://www.labri.fr//perso//falexand/), head of the [Mnemosyne](https://team.inria.fr/mnemosyne/) INRIA team. We try to understand the role of confidence in decision-making.

The PhD defense is scheduled for Autumn 2026.
