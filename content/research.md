## PhD

A growing interest in artificial intelligence, coupled with the frustration of not finding enough time to study it seriously, led me to start a PhD in AI with [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr) in September 2023. So I'm currently back to being a (part-time) student, while retaining the core of my teaching and administrative duties.

More precisely, I am working under the supervision of [Frédéric Alexandre](https://www.labri.fr//perso//falexand/), head of the [Mnemosyne](https://www.inria.fr/fr/mnemosyne) team. My work deals with understanding the role of confidence (*confiance*) in human decision making, with the long-term goal of augmenting AI models with confidence-based abilities.
