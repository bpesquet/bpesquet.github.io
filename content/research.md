## PhD

A growing interest in artificial intelligence, coupled with the frustration of not finding enough time to dedicate to its study, led me to start an AI-centered PhD with [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr).

More precisely, I will be working under the supervision of [Frédéric Alexandre](https://www.labri.fr//perso//falexand//), head of the [Mnemosyne](https://www.inria.fr/fr/mnemosyne) team. Many things are still up in the air, but my work should deal with adding some level of trustworthiness to AI models.
