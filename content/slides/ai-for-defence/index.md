## Context

---

### Impacts of AI on Defence

- Like with all highly technical fields, AI has a growing impact on AI.
- Main areas:
  - Decision and planning support
  - Collaborative combat
  - Cybersecurity and digital influence
  - Logistics and operational readiness
  - Intelligence
  - Robotics and autonomy

---

### A fastly moving ecosystem

- In all countries, traditional defence behemoths (Lockeed Martin, Thales Group, Leonardo...) have embraced AI as a key tool for improving their systems.
- Many startups enter the field with specialized offerings.
- Some new, state-promoted national sectors emerge (example: Israel for cybersecurity).
- Recent conflicts, most notably the Ukraine war, have been catalysts for AI adoption.

- (France) [AI in support of Defence](https://www.defense.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/aid/Report%20of%20the%20AI%20Task%20Force%20September%202019.pdf)
- (EU) [Guidelines for military and non-military use of AI](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20210114IPR95627/guidelines-for-military-and-non-military-use-of-artificial-intelligence)

### Main issue

- AI is used to assist humans in multiple ways.
- Role and task breakdown is the key question: what's assigned to AI, what's left for humans?
- This decision has huge ramifications:
  - Should AI decide to shoot a target autonomously?
  - Who's responsible for what?
  - ...

## Use cases

---

### Missile pack guidance

- Several (5-20) missiles used simultaneously as a pack.
- AI is used to optimize their guidance and help the pilot.
- PhD in progress in Bordeaux.

---

### Pilot assistance

- Single pilot planes (with unchanged cockpits sometimes).
- AI is needed for assistance and decision making.

---

### Object recognition in combat zones

- [Project Maven](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/1254719/project-maven-to-deploy-computer-algorithms-to-war-zone-by-years-end/): a US initiative aiming at categorizing and identifying surveillance footage by low altitude devices.
- Uses sophiticated computer vision algorithms and models.

---

### Homeland security

- Predictive analytics (identifying trends and patterns within a dataset to then predict the likelihood of, and when, that trend will occur again) can be used to correlate signs of preparation for unlawful activities.
- Such services make heavy use of Machine Learning and are offered by companies like [Palantir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir_Technologies).
- There are, of course, many ethical issues.

---

### Prevention of cyberterrorism

- Protecting defence networks by identifying and neutralizing threats (viruses, malware, cybreattacks...).
- Detection of unusual patterns in network usage.
- Associated software leverages various supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms

---

### Autonomous combat units

- "A tank is a car with tracks and a gun".
- Drones and drone swarms.
- (Not there yet) battle robots.
- ...

---

### Battlefield of the future

- A highly complex and dynamic system with multiple human and non-human units interacting in real time.
- Huge flow of information to process.
- AI is used to collect, process and synthesize data for easier and better decision making.
- Dual aspect: same principles can apply to many non-military fields.
