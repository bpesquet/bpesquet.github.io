I regularly host training sessions for professionals or external partners.

Some of them are linked to the continuing education program at [ENSC](https://ensc.bordeaux-inp.fr). More precisely, I recently took part in the [Artificial Intelligence](https://ensc.bordeaux-inp.fr/fr/formation-courte-intelligence-artificielle) short course (in 2021 and 2022) and the [Big Data and Statistics for Engineers](https://ensc.bordeaux-inp.fr/fr/du-big-data-et-statistique-pour-lingenieur) university diploma (since 2019).

From 2021 to 2023, I have been involved in the [Machine Learning for Defence](https://assets-plus.eu/education-training/machine-learning-for-defence/) and [AI for Defence](https://year-of-skills.europa.eu/events-and-activities/assets-education-training-programme-ai-defence-2023-05-22_en) training programs, created as part of the [ASSETs+](https://assets-plus.eu/) european project.
